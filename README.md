# Week-1
Plastic Waste Image Classification using CNN This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of plastic waste into predefined categories (e.g., plastic bottles, bags, etc.). The goal is to leverage deep learning to aid in waste management and recycling efforts by automating the classification process.
